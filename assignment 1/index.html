                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is OgheneO'Tega, I am 19 years of age and an aspiring full-stack developer. 
                </p>
                <p>
                My passion for tech began as a child, watching superhero movies. Of course, I wanted to be a superhero at that time, but as I matured in age and left the crime fighting gig to the properly equipped individuals, I never lost my passion for tech. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Currently, I am a student of AltSchool Africa, a global initiative driven towards equipping young africans with the skill needed to thrive in the tech world, and I couldn't be more excited.
